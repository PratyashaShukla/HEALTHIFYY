The project is a blockchain-based Electronic Health Record (EHR)
system that enables patients to give or remove access to their medical
records to doctors, and allows doctors to add prescriptions with
medicines and time for their patients. The system also sends daily
reminders to patients to take their medicine and notifies doctors if the
patient misses a dosage.
The system utilizes the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storing
patient data, where the Content ID (CID) of the data is stored on the
blockchain. This ensures data security, privacy, and immutability. The
system is built using a combination of technologies, including Node.js,
Express.js, MongoDB, and Ethereum blockchain.
The project report discusses the design and implementation of the
system, including the architecture, data schema, and smart contract
design. The report also covers the various features of the system, such as
patient-doctor interaction, medicine prescription, daily reminders,
missed dosage notifications, and data storage.
